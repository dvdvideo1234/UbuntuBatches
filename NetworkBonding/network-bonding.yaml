# Bonding is configured by declaring a bond
# interface with a list of physical interfaces
# and a bonding mode. Below is an example of
# an active-backup bond that uses DHCP to
# obtain an address:

# mode=0 (balance-rr)
# mode=1 (active-backup)
# mode=2 (balance-xor)
# mode=3 (broadcast)
# mode=4 (802.3ad)
# mode=5 (balance-tlb)
# mode=6 (balance-alb)
