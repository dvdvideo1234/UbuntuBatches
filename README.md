# UbuntuBatches

Some Ubuntu batches I use currently

These scripts are used to perform various tasks
and fix various problems. The content is divided on
folders in which every manager persists:
```
  General        --> Contains an installation procedure for fresh file ubuntu server
  KillAppsWEB    --> Removes the web APPs from an Ubuntu OS
  MaNGOS         --> Configures MaNGOS WoW server on the local network
  MiniDLNA       --> Installs MiniDLNA server when compiling it from source
  RefreshUNITY   --> What to do when your Unity initialization fails
  SteamCMD       --> Configures a SteamCMD game server
  VirtualBox     --> Run this before inserting guest additions in VB
  gksuFix        --> Simple fix for gksu is it does not work
  x11VNC         --> Configures x11VNC server on the port specified.
  OpenTTD        --> Install the game Open TTD in a folder of choice
```

When answering `y` to all installations is needed use: `yes y | sudo ./config.sh`.
