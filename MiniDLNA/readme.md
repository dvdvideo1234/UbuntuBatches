This script is based on the commands from this tutorial:

http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-minidlna-on-ubuntu-ultimate-guide/

### Description
The installation using this script is automatic and it's
done by placing it in a folder of choice, then running it
via `./config.sh` with one of the following parameters:
```
Type "./config.sh" for options:
  "install" Installs miniDLNA after compiling it from the source
  "update"  Updates the miniDLNA installation
  "remove"  Removes the miniDLNA package and auto-start
  "config"  Opens the configuration located in /.minidlna
  "stats"   Views the common script variable paths
```
For example `sudo ./config.sh install` starts the installation.

### Notes
Please do not put `sudo` when changing the server configuration via `config`
The user can chose whenever to install the dependencies needed by
answering a question `[y or n]`. Then it asks for a proxy ( if needed ),
automatically creates a hidden ".minidlna" installation configuration folder,
where the compiled sources are downloaded using "git clone" ( trough the proxy if given ).
Later on if configures, the sources for compilation, creates a configuration file and installs the package.

Auto-start deamon control script is automatically generated inside the file
`minidlna` and copied inside `/etc/init.d/minidlna`

# Controlling the DLNA
```
sudo service minidlna start
sudo service minidlna stop
sudo service minidlna restart
sudo service minidlna status
sudo service minidlna rescan
```
If the service does not start on `restart` or `reload`, be persistent,
run the command again until you get a different Process ID !
```
